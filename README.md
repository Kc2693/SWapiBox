This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and the Star Wars API.
### Description
The point of this project was to continue exercising a knowledge of React, while dealing with difficult nested fetch calls, and learning how to test it all. This was also my first time using async/await.
